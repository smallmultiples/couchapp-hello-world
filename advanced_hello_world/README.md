# More Advanced CouchApp

This example shows the use of Jade templating engine, both with precompiled templates and raw templates.

	sudo npm install -g couchapp
	install couchapp
	npm install jade
	couchapp push app.js http://admin:password@localhost:5984/jadeapp
	
Note: don't know why, I had to install couchapp both globaly and localyâ€¦
also, create the DB jadeapp using futon if it's not there.

Try:
